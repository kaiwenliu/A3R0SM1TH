# A3R0SM1TH
ðŸ’¾ An incredibly lightweight file dropper that downloads and executes a .NET executable (given by a link specified by the user) **completely** in memory. I have yet to add other features to this, but I probably won't because this could be utilized maliciously. I mainly made this as a proof of concept, and so that if others want to implement downloading + running executables in memory, they can use this repositry as a reference.
